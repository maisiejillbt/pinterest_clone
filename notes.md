- completed sign up portion of user auth 
- learned to always push as soon as a function works 
- found out that rails requires its user auth to have a username fld 
  - I ended up having to tie my email and username flds together this way rails will accept a login without a username, I'm planning on making a function to update username to the users choice when I get to the settings portion. there is no username prompt during sign up.
